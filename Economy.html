<h1>Money</h1>
<p> Money is very important in csgo, what weapons you can buy depend on it. But there is more to it,
  coordinated team might decide to not buy weapons even if one player has enough money. But even if everybody has money
  the team might decide to not buy the best weapons depending on the economy of the enemy.
  So here is a little cheat sheet so you can figure out how much money you and the enemy will have next round.
