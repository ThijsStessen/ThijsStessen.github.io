  There are complete
  <a href="http://strike-counter.com/cs-go-stats/weapons-stats" target="_blank"> sites </a>
  dedicated to the different weapons in cs:go so instead of explaing everything in detail I will
  provide a short summary of the different weapon types.
</p>

  <h1> Pistols </h1>
  <p>
  The cs:go pistols are mostly used to save up money whilst not being completely harmless.
  They are also great to use if you run out of bulles with your main weapon.
  In general you should aim at the head when using a pistol as they do little damage against armor.
</p>
<h1> Sub machine guns </h1>
  <p>
SMGs are most effective when used against enimies without armor and strong weapons.
The high fire rate and high kill reward makes them great for spraying down rushing players.
They have a lot of downsides however as they don´t deal a lot of damage, have a low accuracy, and have a high damage dropoff.
  </p>
  <h1> Rifles </h1>
  <p>
    Rifles are the weapons you want to buy if you can afford them, they are powerfull, have a high fire rate, and enough ammo to take out an entire team with one clip.
    The ak47 is arguably the best weapon in the game as it can one-shot headshot an enemie who is wearing a helmet.
    You will want to pick it up even if you already have a different rifle.
  </p>
  <h1> Snipers </h1>
<p>
  Some snipers pack enough punch to kill multiple enemys with one shot but because of their slow fire rate and high cost are not always the best option.
  When trying to clutch many players will prefer a rifle over a sniper so they can kill a player at all ranges.
  Only when your team has enough money and you don´t mind losing $4750 it is a good idea to buy a sniper.

</p>
<h1> Shotguns </h1>
<p>
Shotguns are some of the least usefull weapons in csgo, they are only usefull if the enemy tries to rush at you.
If that doesn´t happen you will be stuck with a short ranged weapon on long range. This and the extremely high kill reward makes shotguns high risk high reward weapons.
</p>
<h1> Machine guns </h1>
<p>
  There are two machine guns in cs:go the m249 and the negev. The m249 is only bought when you are winning 16-0 as it is super expensive and not very good.
  The negev however is in certain situations a viable option.
  Its high fire rate, large ammo capacity, and lazer like recoil make it amazing at spraying a position to provide cover for your teammates.
  The only downside is that any skilled player can take you out easily if they have a rifle or sniper.
